## Introduction
- Btrm stand for "backup then remove", this project aim to replace build-in command rm in Unix system.
- The rm -rf command is one of the fastest way to delete a folder and its contents. But a little typo or ignorance may result into unrecoverable system damage. So we decide to built our alternative tool to remove file but with **backup mechanism**.
