By default, btrm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R)
option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo',
use one of these commands:
  rm -- -foo

  rm ./-foo

Note that if you use btrm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some 
of its contents within 60 days, given sufficient expertise and/or time. For greater
assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.
